13. Take a few minutes to explore other aspects of the migration assessment.

#### Task summary 

In this task you created and configured an Azure Migrate migration assessment.

### Task 5: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Windows, Linux and SQL Server**. Under **Discovery and assessment** select **Groups**,

    ![](images/Exercise1/azure-migrate-group.png)   

2. Select the **SmartHotel VMs** group to see the group details. 

    ![](images/Exercise1/select-group.png)   

3. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel VMs group. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'.](images/Exercise1/requires-agent-installation-v2.png "SmartHotel VMs server group")

   > **Note:** You do not need to configure the workspace ID and key when installing the Dependency Agent, since it uses the same settings as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, which must be installed beforehand.

23. Close the virtual machine connection window for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.  Connect to the **smarthotelweb2** VM and repeat the installation process (steps 10-21) for both agents (the administrator password is the same as for smarthotelweb1). Close the virtual machine connection window for the **smarthotelweb2** VM, once the installation of agents is done.

You will now deploy the Linux versions of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on the **UbuntuWAF** VM. To do so, you will first connect to the UbuntuWAF remotely using an SSH session.

24. Open a command prompt using the desktop shortcut.  

    > **Note**: The SmartHotelHost runs Windows Server 2019 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled. This allows the command prompt to be used as an SSH client. More info of supported Linux on Azure can be found here: https://Azure.com/Linux. 

25. Enter the following command to connect to the **UbuntuWAF** VM running in Hyper-V on the SmartHotelHost:

    ```bash
    ssh demouser@192.168.0.8
    ```

26. Enter 'yes' when prompted whether to connect. Use the password **demo!pass123**.

    ![Screenshot showing the command prompt with an SSH session to UbuntuWAF.](images/Exercise1/ssh.png "SSH session with UbuntuWAF")

27. Enter the following command, followed by the password **demo!pass123** when prompted:

    ```s
    sudo -s
    ```

    This gives the terminal session elevated privileges.

28. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> and \<Workspace Key\> with the values copied previously. Answer **Yes** when prompted to restart services during package upgrades without asking.  

    ```s
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <Workspace ID> -s <Workspace Key>
    ```

29. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> with the value copied earlier:

    ```s
    /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart <Workspace ID>
    ```

30. Enter the following command. This downloads a script that will install the Dependency Agent.

    ```s
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
    ```

31. Install the dependency agent by running the script download in the previous step.

    ```s
    sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing that the Dependency Agent install on Linux was successful.](images/Exercise1/da-linux-done.png "Dependency Agent installation was successful")

32. The agent installation is now complete. Next, you need to generate some traffic on the SmartHotel application so the dependency visualization has some data to work with. From the **SmartHotelHostRG** resources group, naviagate to **Smarthost{SUFFIX}** VM and browse to the public IP address of the VM and spend a few minutes refreshing the page and checking guests in and out.
    
#### Task summary 

In this task you configured the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature, by creating a Log Analytics workspace and deploying the Azure Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on both Windows and Linux on-premises machines.

### Task 6: Explore dependency visualization

In this task, you will explore the dependency visualization feature of Azure Migrate. This feature uses data gathered by the dependency agent you installed in Task 5.

1. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **SmartHotel VMs** VM group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as 'Installed'. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.  It may take up to **5 minutes** after installation for the status to be updated.)

    ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](images/Exercise1/dependency-viz-installed.png "Dependency agent installed")
